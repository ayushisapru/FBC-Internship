# FBC-Internship
During my internship with the Systems Applications team at Fort Bend County, I collaborated with my intern team to develop a comprehensive juvenile mental health survey. Our project involved designing and implementing an SQL database and developing an API. We leveraged a large tech stack to create the survey and enhance UX and visual appeal.
